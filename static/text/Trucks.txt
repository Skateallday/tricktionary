Coming in pairs, Trucks are what hold the wheels to the board and where all the grinds take place. Composed of a baseplate, kingpin, bushings, axel and two nuts, the trucks are used for turning the board.
The tighter the kingpin is, the stiffer the bushings will be. This will make turning much harder.
